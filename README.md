An infinite runner game, or is it?
You dodge obstacles and get powerups and score boosters while trying to beat your highscore. This may sound like an infinite runner but wait till you reach level 100.

All code and art is mine. The soundfiles are not mine and credits are in the source code. 

Instructions:
Arrow keys to move. 
Click the PAUSE on the screen to pause or press the space bar.
In level 2 press X to attack the enemy


For ease of experiencing the game:

Press F to skip to 35 to see the snail/turtle on the rocket which slows down the enemies

Press S to skip to the second level with the boss fight(spoiler)
