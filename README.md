# pygame
An infinite runner game, or is it?
You dodge obstacles and get powerups and score boosters while trying to beat your highscore. This may sound like an infinite runner but wait till you reach level 100(There just might be a boss fight).

All code and art is mine. The soundfiles are not mine and credits are in the source code. Instructions to play the game can be found in the README.txt file.
